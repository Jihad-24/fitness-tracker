# 6. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):

# 7. Error Handling and Page Not Found:
   Incorporates an ErrorPage component to handle routes that do not match any defined paths.Ensures a user-friendly experience by redirecting users to an error page when they attempt to access invalid routes or pages that donâ€™t exist.

# 8. Private Routes:
   Some routes are protected and can only be accessed by authenticated users. The PrivateRoute component ensures that only authenticated users can access specific sections of the website.

# 9. JWT (JSON Web Tokens) Token-Based Authentication:
    When a user registers or logs into your website, the authentication process involves generating a JWT (JSON Web Token).After successful authentication, the JWT is issued to the user as a means of identifying and authenticating them for subsequent requests.The JWT is used as an authentication token, and it is included and stored in a secure client-side storage (local storage).The server checks the validity of the JWT for each protected endpoint or route to ensure that the user has the necessary permissions to access the resource.

These are the key features and functionalities of my website.
